    <p>
        Click to re-index the 27000 rows individually into Examine. This will take a VERY long time because when processing one node
        at a time, it commits the changes to the index on each iteration, then after 100 iterations it will re-optimize the index and by default
        Lucene will have the merge count reasonably low so about every 20 iterations the files will be merged to one. Each of these operations is
        an expensive operation so it is advised to never bulk re-index many nodes at a time individually.
